# Petpooja Webhooks

## Todos

- All responses and requests currently are incomplete and some properties are missing.(We found missing in response, so start from there.)
- It looks like error responses of most of webhooks contain same keys and same error format. Hence we can reduce code duplicacy.
- Response code for all webhooks is 400 but we haven't implemented them yet.
- Create a list of all routes.
